		<p>Hi! I'm a researcher living in Guangzhou, China on a Fulbright US 
           Student Award. Having spent the last four years studying chemistry 
           in college, I currently work in a lab at Guangzhou University of 
           Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), investigating the use of 
           TCM-derived compounds as chemosensitizers for cancer chemotherapy. 
           Outside of the lab, I’m also interested in learning about the 
           important role that TCM plays in Chinese society. As I encounter it 
           in class, at home, and in hospitals, I work to maintain both an open
           mind and a healthy amount of skepticism. 
        </p>
        <p>
           To me, Guangzhou is both new and nostalgic; it is my mother’s hometown, 
           and a place that I visited three times as a very young tourist with 
           almost no Chinese language skills. Now, as I live and work here, I 
           hope to compare the China of today to the pre-1985 China that I have 
           only heard about, as well as the China that is fuzzy in my memory. 
           Because my face doesn’t typically betray my Chinese heritage, I am 
           also learning about the distinct experiences that come with living 
           here as a foreigner. 
        </p>

           This blog is, of course, a way for me to share my reflections with 
           you. It is also my own personal experiment in web design, and 
           hopefully you will notice new features and updates as I work on it 
           over time. Aside from the interests noted above, I love music, and 
           would love to sing or play or listen with you. I’m also looking for 
           ping pong and amateur 毽子（shuttlecock）-kicking partners, and enjoy 
           discussing veganism and US prison reform, among other topics. 
        </p>
